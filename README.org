* verify-conformance

#+begin_quote
a GitHub bot for verifying conformance submissions on github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance
#+end_quote

The behaviour of the bot is described here, in [[https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/][Gherkin]].  Each scenario is a requirement a PR must meet to qualify for conformance.

Note: the line immediately beneath the scenario is the comment posted to the PR if the requirement is not met.

See the feature scenarios, [[./kodata/features/verify-conformance-release.feature][in ./kodata/features]].
